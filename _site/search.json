One of the most importants thigns when you are learning R is understand how to work with these objects because you will have the confidence and knowledge to use it at your better convenience. There are several types of objects in R, including vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, and factors, each with their own characteristics and uses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\nTo create an object, give it a name followed by the assignment operator, followed by the value/data type.\nAssignment operator <-\nShortcut: “Alt + -” on PC, “Option + -” on Mac\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nIn this image, you can see the different types of objects that we have and this is the best way to visualize.

    "text": "Install R and Rstudio: why R rocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR provides a versatile and powerful toolset for users of all skill levels, making it the go-to choice if you’re looking for a cutting-edge solution for your data analysis needs. R has everything you need to advance your data analysis, regardless of your experience level or where you are in your career. We assure you won’t be disappointed, so why not join the millions of happy users who have already switched to R?\nR is a free, open-source programming language that is widely used in data analysis and statistical computing. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easier to write and run R code. Installing R and RStudio is straightforward and can be done in a few simple steps:\n\nWhy R?\nDue to its many benefits in statistical computing and data analysis, R is a strong and flexible programming language that has gained popularity recently. Here are some of the main benefits of using R:\n\nOpen source software: R is open source, so users can access and alter the source code to tailor the program to their needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages: Users can use R’s extensive package library to add functionality for specialized tasks like tables, visualization, and data manipulation. Right now, there are more than 18,000 packages available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy to use: R has an intuitive user interface that makes it simple for new users to learn and offers advanced features for seasoned users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Install R\nFirst, you need to install R on your computer. You can download the latest version of R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website. Follow these steps:\n\nGo to the CRAN website and click on the “Download R for (Windows/MacOS/Linux)” link.\nChoose your operating system from the list and click on the corresponding link to download the installation file.\nOnce the file is downloaded, run the installation program and follow the instructions.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Install RStudio\nThe latest version of RStudio can be downloaded from the RStudio website. After you have installed R, you can install RStudio, an optional but highly recommended IDE for R. The following actions should be taken.\n\nVisit the RStudio website and select “RStudio Desktop” from the list of available products.\nFrom the list, select your operating system, and then click the link to download the installation file.\nRun the installation program after the file has been downloaded, then adhere to the prompts.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Launch RStudio\nOnce you have installed R and RStudio, you can launch RStudio by double-clicking on its icon . When you first launch RStudio, you will be prompted to select a version of R to use. If you have installed only one version of R, it should be automatically selected. Otherwise, you can choose the version of R that you want to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady\n\n\n\nYou’ve now successfully installed R and RStudio on your computer. Now that R and RStudio are installed, you can begin writing and running R code."

In this case, ggplot2 helps us learn the core of how ggplot2 works and how we can get the best advantage of it.\n“This book provides a hands-on introduction to ggplot2 with lots of example code and graphics. It also explains the grammar on which ggplot2 is based. Like other formal systems, ggplot2 is useful even when you don’t understand the underlying model. However, the more you learn about it, the more effectively you’ll be able to use ggplot2. This book will introduce you to ggplot2 assuming that you’re a novice, unfamiliar with the grammar; teach you the basics so that you can re-create plots you are already familiar with; show you how to use the grammar to create new types of graphics; and eventually turn you into an expert who can build new components to extend the grammar.”\n\n\n\nGo to ggplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCite\n\n\n\nHadley, W.

In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time.

    "text": "Authors Edzer Pebesma Roger Bivand\n\n\nOne of the things that I like about R is how flexible it is as a tool or a “swiss knife” because you can employ different tools that before weren’t possible. One of them is Spatial Analysis and this book provides a robust theoretical and practical background using R for Spatial analysis. It’s updated and delivers clear examples of how spatial data is super useful for data analysis and other purposes.\n“This book introduces and explains the concepts underlying spatial data: points, lines, polygons, rasters, coverages, geometry attributes, data cubes, reference systems, as well as higher-level concepts including how attributes relate to geometries and how this affects analysis. The relationship of attributes to geometries is known as support, and changing support also changes the characteristics of attributes. Some data generation processes are continuous in space, and may be observed everywhere. Others are discrete, observed in tesselated containers. In modern spatial data analysis, tesellated methods are often used for all data, extending across the legacy partition into point process, geostatistical and lattice models. It is support (and the understanding of support) that underlies the importance of spatial representation. The book aims at data scientists who want to get a grip on using spatial data in their analysis. To exemplify how to do things, it uses R”\n\n\n\nGo to Spatial Data Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCite\n\n\n\nPebesma, E., & Bivand, R. (2023). Spatial Data Science: With Applications in R.
