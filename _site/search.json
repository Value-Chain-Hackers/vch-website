    "text": "Install R and Rstudio: why R rocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR provides a versatile and powerful toolset for users of all skill levels, making it the go-to choice if you’re looking for a cutting-edge solution for your data analysis needs. R has everything you need to advance your data analysis, regardless of your experience level or where you are in your career. We assure you won’t be disappointed, so why not join the millions of happy users who have already switched to R?\nR is a free, open-source programming language that is widely used in data analysis and statistical computing. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easier to write and run R code. Installing R and RStudio is straightforward and can be done in a few simple steps:\n\nWhy R?\nDue to its many benefits in statistical computing and data analysis, R is a strong and flexible programming language that has gained popularity recently. Here are some of the main benefits of using R:\n\nOpen source software: R is open source, so users can access and alter the source code to tailor the program to their needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages: Users can use R’s extensive package library to add functionality for specialized tasks like tables, visualization, and data manipulation. Right now, there are more than 18,000 packages available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy to use: R has an intuitive user interface that makes it simple for new users to learn and offers advanced features for seasoned users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Install R\nFirst, you need to install R on your computer. You can download the latest version of R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website. Follow these steps:\n\nGo to the CRAN website and click on the “Download R for (Windows/MacOS/Linux)” link.\nChoose your operating system from the list and click on the corresponding link to download the installation file.\nOnce the file is downloaded, run the installation program and follow the instructions.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Install RStudio\nThe latest version of RStudio can be downloaded from the RStudio website. After you have installed R, you can install RStudio, an optional but highly recommended IDE for R. The following actions should be taken.\n\nVisit the RStudio website and select “RStudio Desktop” from the list of available products.\nFrom the list, select your operating system, and then click the link to download the installation file.\nRun the installation program after the file has been downloaded, then adhere to the prompts.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Launch RStudio\nOnce you have installed R and RStudio, you can launch RStudio by double-clicking on its icon . When you first launch RStudio, you will be prompted to select a version of R to use. If you have installed only one version of R, it should be automatically selected. Otherwise, you can choose the version of R that you want to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady\n\n\n\nYou’ve now successfully installed R and RStudio on your computer. Now that R and RStudio are installed, you can begin writing and running R code."

    "text": "This is a course offered by the CISCO Networking Academy. What I really like is that at the end it offers a proof of completion. This certification in combination with other tools it’s a good way to start with Python. Here I leave the summary of the CISCO website and the link as well.\n\n“How great would it be to write your own computer program? Python is a multi-paradigm programming language used by startups and tech giants like Google, Facebook, Netflix, and more. With intuitive, readable syntax, Python is a great first programming language to learn.\nProgramming skills open you up to careers in almost any industry and are required if you want to continue to more advanced and higher paying software development and engineering roles.\nThis course is a great place to start learning Python – no prior programming knowledge required. Completing the course earns you a Statement of Achievement. It is split into two parts preparing you for two certifications:\nPart 1 (PE1: 35 hours) prepares you for PCEP – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer Certification. Part 2 (PE2: 40 hours) prepares you for PCAP – Certified Associate in Python Programming Certification.”\nYou’ll learn these core skills:\n\nThink algorithmically – how to analyze a problem and translate it for a computer to process.\nDesign, develop, and improve multi-module computer programs.\nAnalyze and model real-life problems in Object-Oriented Programming categories.\nUnderstand a programmer’s work in the software development process.\nLearn how a program is executed in a computer environment.\nGain skills to create and develop your own programming portfolio.\n\n\nCISCO Networking Academy\n\n\n\n\nGo to CISCO PCAP"

It gives you a clear structure, good practices for coding, and all the basis that you need. —100% recommended.\n\n“R4DS teaches you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to R for Data Science"

    "text": "What I like about this book is that it gives you exercises, practice code, and the theory behind visualization and storytelling. Kieran Healy provides fantastic examples of plots and makes you understand the critical concepts behind ggplot. If you want to have a solid theoretical basis for plots and practical examples, this is your bible now.\n\n“This book is a hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of looking at and presenting data using R and ggplot. R is a powerful, widely used, and freely available programming language for data analysis. You may be interested in exploring ggplot after having used R before, or be entirely new to both R and ggplot and just want to graph your data. I do not assume you have any prior knowledge of R.”\nIf you follow the text and examples in this book, then by the end you will:\n\nUnderstand the basic principles behind effective data visualization.\nHave a practical sense for why some graphs and figures work well, while others may fail to inform or actively mislead.\nKnow how to create a wide range of plots in R using ggplot2.\nKnow how to refine plots for effective presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Data Visualization"
