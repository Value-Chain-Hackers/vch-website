    "text": "The ability to extract and manipulate data from PDF files is an essential skill for anyone who works with digital documents. For example: organizations, governments, universities, and businesses use themas tools to publish data. Just imagine this: I’ve often seen governments publish their data in pdfs as tables. As a public policy maker or as a data analyst, that can be painful; imagine translate all that information by hand or using paid tools as PDFTables or Convert from PDF to Excel online. This is where Python and the pdfplumber and tabulate libraries comes in handy: it allows us to extract text, tables, and other data from PDF files with ease, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and processing. I would also add that this skill is useful as a crucial step for Natural Language Processing since a lot of potential inputs right now are just in pdf texts.\nIn the next lines, I’ll show how we can extract text from PDF documents that also includes tables. This approach is easy to understand and reliable, so, anyone can posses and domain this skill; you just need a little bit of knowledge about Python and how we can work with objects.\nIf you are working within your Python environment, please install this packages. Otherwise, I’ll give you the google collab where you can run Python code without installing it in your computer."

    "text": "Extract data from a PDF document\nThis is the document that we will use to this example. It’s a document from the Hertie School that describes the Study, Examination, and Admission Rules in 2016 for the MPP program. Here our goal will be extract all the content from it and put it in a dataframe.\n\n#Import libraries\nimport pdfplumber as pp\nimport pandas as pd\n\n#Set PDF file name\npdf = 'MPP_Study_Example.pdf'\n\n#Open PDF file and extract data from each page\nwith pp.open(pdf) as book:\n    #Initialize an empty list to store text\n    page_data = []\n    #Loop over each page in the PDF file\n    for page_no, page in enumerate(book.pages, start = 1):\n        #Extract text from page\n        data = page.extract_text()\n        #Append page data to list\n        page_data.append([pdf, data.strip(), page_no])\n\n#Create pandas DataFrame from page data and set column names\ndf_text = pd.DataFrame(page_data, columns=['file_name', 'text', 'page_number'])\n\n#Display DataFrame\nprint(df_text)\n\n               file_name                                               text   \n0  MPP_Study_Example.pdf  Master of Public Policy\\nStudy, Examination, a...  \\\n1  MPP_Study_Example.pdf  I.

The first one shows the document’s name where we extracted the text. The second column contains the text, and the third one the number of pages. Of course, you can modify the code and the variable names according to your necessities.\nIf you want to save your dataframe, remember this functions:\n\n# Save the dataframe to a CSV file\ndf_text.to_csv('df_text_pdf.csv', index=False)\n\n# Save the dataframe to an Excel file\ndf_text.to_excel('df_text_pdf.xlsx', index=False)\n\nIf you look close, there is a table in page number 5. PDFplumber renders that as text and not in a table format. One approach to this would be use now the tabulate library to extract exclsuively tables from our document. The table inside the document is not clear or doesn’t have a completely table format. However, we can still apply our function to extract that table and approach it to a nice table format.\n\n#Import required libraries\nimport tabula\nimport numpy as np\nfrom tabula import read_pdf\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n#Set the path to the PDF file\npdf_path = 'MPP_Study_Example.pdf'\n\n#Read all tables from the PDF file into a list of DataFrames\ndf_list = tabula.read_pdf(pdf_path, pages=\"all\", multiple_tables=True)\n\n#Print the list of DataFrames\nprint(df_list)\n\n[    (2)   \n0   NaN  \\\n1   (3)   \n2   NaN   \n3   NaN   \n4   NaN   \n5   NaN   \n6   (4)   \n7   NaN   \n8   NaN   \n9   (5)   \n10  NaN   \n11  (6)   \n12  NaN   \n13  NaN   \n14  NaN   \n15  (7)   \n16  NaN   \n17  NaN   \n18  (8)   \n\n   The Academic Senate of the Hertie School of Governance elects the faculty members for a  \n0   two-year term and the student representative f...                                       \n1   The Examination Committee meets in camera and ...                                       \n2   the Committee are obliged to maintain secrecy ...                                       \n3   them in their capacity as members of the Commi...                                       \n4   individual students.

    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\n\nI remember when I started to code in R. I was highly inefficient and didn’t know any of the RStudio capabilities. I manually typed every part of the assignment operator (< and then -), as well as every # at the start of all the lines I wanted to comment. The mouse was my main tool to open new scripts, change tabs, and close tabs. When I had to read or write any file I had to double check how it was written and where it was located. And when an important script was lost, I did not have any alternative other than to check every one of the folders where I thought it could be placed.\nAt first I did not imagine that a blessed group of people already had thought about smart ways to tackle these and many other difficulties.\nEverything started to change for me when I saw a colleague selecting multiples lines of code and commenting them all at once. I was amazed. I asked him how he did it, and from that point I started my journey to learn and use new shortcuts and commands in RStudio.\nIf you have kept thinking on how to speed up your code writing process or even if you only want to be more comfortable developing code, then you have arrived to the right place! In this brief tutorial I share some of the shortcuts I use the most. Besides from my own experience, I have also looked for what other users have talked on the subject (check Section 10).\nTo make this tutorial a little bit more intuitive. I have split the text in the next categories:\n\nInsert code\nEdit code\nMove between panes and tabs\nFind files and functions\nRunning code\nCode completion\nSnippets\n\nAll the shortcuts in this tutorial will be listed inside of a table, where the title is the name (or description) of the shortcut, and the body shows how the shortcut should be typed for Windows and Mac OS. With nothing less to add let’s start!\nShow keyboard shortcuts help is the first thing you have to keep in mind. This shortcut brings up a screen listing some of some of the most useful shortcuts in RStudio. In case you want to check the full list of shortcuts, in the upper right corner of the help screen you will find a link called See All Shortcuts. It will take you to a page containing all the shortcuts divided by OS. To exit the help screen you just have to press Esc.\n\nShow keyboard shortcuts help\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nAlt+Shift+K\nOption+Shift+K\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to check for the full list of shortcuts\n\n\n\n\n2 Insert code\n\nWant to create a new R Script? easy-peasy!\n\nCreate a new R Script\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtr+Shift+N\nCmd+Shift+N\n\n\n\nYou want to assign an object? Instead of writting <- key by key, you can do it directly by pressing:\n\nInsert assignment operator <-\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nAlt+-\nOption+-\n\n\n\nWhile concatenating functions or operations, forget about writing the pipe opearator by hand. You can insert it directly by pressing:\n\nInsert pipe operator%>% or |>\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Shift+M\nCmd+Shift+M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe type of pipe that is going to be inserted is defined at Global Options.\nCurrently there are two pipes that are commonly used:\n\nthe magrittr pipe %>%, and\nthe native pipe |>.\n\nYou can preset the pipe you want to insert by accessing Global Options/Code/Editing and defining if you want to use the native pipe (in case you don’t, the magrittr pipe will be automatically used).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can forget of writing every component of the code chunks by hand while working on a Quarto or an R Markdown file, by using the insert code chunk shortcut.\nIt certainly will save you a good amount of time. Besides, it will help you to keep focused in the main things while creating a Notebook: improve your writing and develop code.\n\nInsert code chunk (for Quarto and RMarkdown)\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Alt+I\nCmd+Option+I\n\n\n\nComment/uncomment current line selection is one of the first shortcuts that I learned, and currently it is still among the ones I use the most. Instead of manually adding # at the start of each line you want to comment, select the section of code you want to coment, and then and then use this shortcut. Since commenting code is very common, this shortcut will save you an enormous amount of time.\n\nComment/uncomment current line selection\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Shift+C\nCmd+Shift+C\n\n\n\nIn case you are looking how to organize your code scripts sections, subsections and other sorting levels, you will be happy to find about how to insert a new code section. This is ideal to have a good structure of your code, and the best part is that all the sections and subsections that you create will be visible in the code outline that is next to the Source button in Rstudio.\n\nInsert a new code section\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Shift+R\nCmd+Shift+R\n\n\n\nHere’s how to Toggle document outline in case you were looking for it.\n\nToggle document outline\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Shift+O\nCmd+Shift+O\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe section breaks have a similar structure as the Quarto and RMarkdown headings. The number of #’s at the beginning of each line defines the level of the headers:\n\n# stands for 1st level header,\n## stands for 2nd level headers,\n### stands for 3rd level headers, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of manually indenting your code, you can make a selection of the code and indent every selected line. If want to reindent all the content of a script, first select all (Ctrl + A for Windows, or Cmd + A for Mac) and then reindent. This will save you a lot of time and headaches figuring out how the code should be indented. This is a great aid to visually structure your code.\n\nReindent selection\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+I\nCmd+I\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Edit code\n\nYou can move lines of code up or down without having to copy them.\n\nMove lines up/down\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nAlt+Up/Down\nOption+Up/Down\n\n\n\nYou can also copy lines of code up or down without having to copy and paste them.\n\nCopy lines up/down\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nShift+Alt+Up/Down\nOption+Cmd+Up/Down\n\n\n\nYou can select code without using the mouse. To create or modify a selection using the keyboard, you have to maintain Shift pressed while moving your cursor. This will select anything that have been passed by your cursor. Once you stop pressing Shift you will stop modifying your selection.\n\nSelect\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nShift+[Arrow]\nShift+[Arrow]\n\n\n\nYou can move your cursor directly to the start or the end of a line only with your keyboard following the next key combination:\n\nMove cursor to start/end of line\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nAlt+Left/Right\nCmd+Left/Right\n\n\n\nYou can also move your cursor to the start or the end of a word with the following shortcut:\n\nJump to word (move cursor to start/end of word)\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Left/Right\nOption+Left/Right\n\n\n\nYou can add multiple cursors to edit multiple lines of code simultaneously. For that you need to press the next combination of keys.\n\nAdd cursor Above/Below current cursor\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Alt+Up/Down\nCtrl+Option+Up/Down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOnce you know how to select, move the cursor to the start/end of a line, move the cursor to the start/end of a word, and add multiple cursors, you have all the ingredients to make more complex selections. You can combine select with any of these shortcuts to get different types of selections.\nHere is an examples (in Mac format):\n\nYou can make a selection from your cursor position to the end of a line by pressing Shift+Alt+Left in Windows (or Shift+Cmd+Left in Mac).\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Move between panes and tabs\n\nYou can move focus to Source Editor, i.e., place the cursor in the active script, without taking your hands out of the keyboard with the following shortcut.\n\nMove focus to Source Editor\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+1\nCtrl+1\n\n\n\nThe same idea goes for the console. You can place the cursor in the Console by using:\n\nMove focus to Console\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+2\nCtrl+2\n\n\n\nI mainly use the shortcuts to move the cursor between the Source Editor (1) and the Console (2). In any case, you can focus the following elements inside RStudio just by changing the number of the key combination:\n\n1 - Source Editor\n2 - Console\n3 - Help\n4 - History\n5 - Files\n6 - Plots\n7 - Packages\n8 - Environment\n9 - Viewer\n\nTo move between tabs without taking your hands out of the keyboard you have to type:\n\nOpen previous/next tab\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Alt+Left/Right\nCtrl+Option+Left/Right\n\n\n\nThe previous shortcut may not be practical if you have opened many tabs. If you know the name of the tab you want to go, you can open it directly using Switch to tab which shows a list of all the tabs. You can look for a specific tab by writing its name and access it by pressing enter.\n\nSwitch to tab\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Shift+.\nCtrl+Shift+.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch to tab…\n\n\nYou can close current document once you have finished working on it. This is very usefull to close multiple tabs without using the mouse.\n\nClose current document\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+W\nCmd+W\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Find files and functions\n\nFind/Replace text shows a find/replace utility were you can find everything that match your search, one by one (by pressing the Next or Prev buttons), or at once (pressing All). It also lets you replace all the matches with another text. When a part of the of code is previously selected, the search and replace utility will only look into the selected code by default. You can modify the behavior of this utility by modifying its different options.\n\nFind/Replace text (in active tab)\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+F\nCmd+F\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting all the text that matches with the word fear\n\n\nThe shortcut Go to file/function brings up a search box that allows you to:\n\naccess the files where you have defined specific functions, or\nopen files that are present in your current working directory.\n\nTo do this, you will have to type the name of the file/function that you want to check and then press enter.\n\nGo to file/function\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+.\nCtrl+.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for the basic_fun function among the files of a working directory\n\n\nIn my consideration the most powerful and usefull search tool in the RStudio IDE is Find in files. It lets you find any text that matches your search among all the files present under your working directory or in any directory that you specify. It will list you all the findings disaggregating them by location. Just as Find/replace text this utility also lets you replace all the matches with specified text.\n\nFind in files\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Shift+F\nCmd+Shift+F\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for the word and among the RScripts of a given directory\n\n\n\n\n6 Run code\n\nThe most basic way to execute code in the Source Editor is to put the cursor in the line (or selection) of code you want to run and use this shortcut. This will execute the current line (or selection) and move your cursor to the next part of the code. It is very useful when you are running your Scritps step by step.\n\nRun current line or selection\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Enter\nCmd+Enter\n\n\n\nThis shortcut is similar to the previous one, except that the cursor will remain in its place after executing the code. It can be very useful, specially while making code tests or developing figures in ggplot, and you don’t want to move your cursor away every time the code is executed.\n\nRun current line or selection (without moving cursor)\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nAlt+Enter\nOption+Enter\n\n\n\nImagine that you have written a lot of lines in a script and you would like to run continue modifying it after restarting your computer You don’t have to run the code line by line until you arrive to a specific part of the code. With this shortcut you can place your cursor in a line and run everything before it. It is one of my favorites.\n\nRun from document Beginning to current line\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Alt+B\nCtrl+Option+B\n\n\n\nThis is the complement of the previous shortcut. After placing the cursor in a specific line, you can run the rest of the code by using:\n\nRun from current line to document End\n\n\nWindows \nMac \n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Alt+E\nCtrl+Option+E\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Code completion\n\nOnce you start typing, a completion list will pop up showing the names of functions, objects and snippets that match your text. If the list is not shown, you can make it appear by pressing Tab after typing something. Inside the list use the Up/Down arrows to move between the suggestions, and press Enter or Tab to select an option. To exit the completion list without making a selection just press Esc.\n\n\n\nCode completion of read\n\n\nWhile using functions, you can list their arguments by pressing Tab or Ctrl+Space inside the function parentheses. As in the previous case, you have to use the Up/Down arrows to move between the options and press Enter or Tab once you have made your selection. This can be extremely useful if you want to be very specific about the arguments that are used inside of a function.\n\n\n\nShowing the arguments of the read.csv function\n\n\nIf you are using paths to read or write files, RStudio also has a completion tool to speed things up. To enter the path completion list you have to write quotation marks \"\" and press Tab while your cursor is inside. A list showing the folders and files of your current working directory will appear. You can navigate between the options using the Up/Down arrows or you can type the name of the file/folder you want to go. Press Enter or Tab to make your selection. If you have accessed a new folder the process will repeat until you select a file.\n\n\n\nPath completion while reading csv files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhile navigating locations to save or read files, it is important to consider the following:\n\n\"\" starts navigation at your current working directory,\n\"/\" starts navigation at you root directory, and\n\"../\" starts navigation one level above the working directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n8 Snippets\n\nSnippets are pieces of re-usable boilerplate code. They are very useful to avoid the repetition of writing several lines of code since they are a way to automate the insertion of pre-made pieces of code.\nTo insert a snippet you have to write it and then select it from a completion list. It will be inserted along with some text placeholders which you can fill in. To move to the next placeholder you have to press Tab.\nLet’s use the fun snippet, used to define new functions. First we have to write fun in an R script and select it from an autocompletion list. You will be able to recognize it because it has the {snippet} tag.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, the fun snippet will be inserted with three placeholders: one to define the function name, another to define the function variables, and the last one to define the body of the function. Don’t forget to press Tab to move to the next placeholder once you finish filling them!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a list of some useful snippets:\n\nfun to declare a new function,\nlib to declare a new library to be imported,\nmat to insert a new matrix,\nfor to insert a for loop,\nwhile to insert a while loop,\nif to insert an if conditional statement,\nel to insert and else conditional statement,\nei to insert and else if conditional statement,\napply to insert an apply function, and\nshiny to insert a shiny app template.\n\nBesides, you can customize and create your own snippets!. To do this, you have to access Global Options/Code/Editing and click into Edit Snippets.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can look for more details on how to create custom snippets at this website.\n\n\n9 Conclusion\n\nAs we have seen here, there are several shortcuts and commands that are incorporated into the RStudio IDE. It will take you some time learning and getting used to them. You will practice some more than others, and that is normal. Every developer has different tasks and priorities. Little by little you will notice how you are incorporating them in your usual workflow, and eventually, you will know more tips and tricks than the ones listed in this site.\nIn the meanwhile, I hope this is useful for you, and I wish you the best of lucks in your path developing R code!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nJust one last thing.

    "text": "Install R and Rstudio: why R rocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR provides a versatile and powerful toolset for users of all skill levels, making it the go-to choice if you’re looking for a cutting-edge solution for your data analysis needs. R has everything you need to advance your data analysis, regardless of your experience level or where you are in your career. We assure you won’t be disappointed, so why not join the millions of happy users who have already switched to R?\nR is a free, open-source programming language that is widely used in data analysis and statistical computing. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easier to write and run R code. Installing R and RStudio is straightforward and can be done in a few simple steps:\n\nWhy R?\nDue to its many benefits in statistical computing and data analysis, R is a strong and flexible programming language that has gained popularity recently. Here are some of the main benefits of using R:\n\nOpen source software: R is open source, so users can access and alter the source code to tailor the program to their needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages: Users can use R’s extensive package library to add functionality for specialized tasks like tables, visualization, and data manipulation. Right now, there are more than 18,000 packages available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy to use: R has an intuitive user interface that makes it simple for new users to learn and offers advanced features for seasoned users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Install R\nFirst, you need to install R on your computer. You can download the latest version of R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website. Follow these steps:\n\nGo to the CRAN website and click on the “Download R for (Windows/MacOS/Linux)” link.\nChoose your operating system from the list and click on the corresponding link to download the installation file.\nOnce the file is downloaded, run the installation program and follow the instructions.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Install RStudio\nThe latest version of RStudio can be downloaded from the RStudio website. After you have installed R, you can install RStudio, an optional but highly recommended IDE for R. The following actions should be taken.\n\nVisit the RStudio website and select “RStudio Desktop” from the list of available products.\nFrom the list, select your operating system, and then click the link to download the installation file.\nRun the installation program after the file has been downloaded, then adhere to the prompts.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Launch RStudio\nOnce you have installed R and RStudio, you can launch RStudio by double-clicking on its icon . When you first launch RStudio, you will be prompted to select a version of R to use. If you have installed only one version of R, it should be automatically selected. Otherwise, you can choose the version of R that you want to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady\n\n\n\nYou’ve now successfully installed R and RStudio on your computer. Now that R and RStudio are installed, you can begin writing and running R code."

    "text": "Who doesn’t remember their first love? In my case, in the coding world, my first love was Stata. I clearly remember my first job as a research assistant to Laura Atuesta. Learning Stata implied an important learning curve since this language was used in my university for my classes, my work, and research. I did my bachelor’s thesis with Stata, and, being honest, I just have great memories using Stata because it was the first time that I’ve feel capable of doing multiple things. There my curiosity for data science and coding started. However, like any other Story love (that may be doesn’t end well), I met R. I would say with this language my interest and passion for coding exploded. Since then, I stopped using Stata and fall in love completely for R. Syntaxis, open-source building community and the approach that you can have with this language are just one of the multiple reasons why I decided to keep learning with R. It doesn’t matter what happens, Stata will be always in the bottom of my heart and my first love since it was the first coding language that I learned.\nBecause of this and because I know that different people and scholars are using Stata and they are curious about what R offers, here is an essential guide of commands for doing some data wrangling, analysis, and running some models. Of course, I don’t cover plenty of things, but this is just to show the differences between using R and Stata. I’m sorry if I don’t use the new Stata approaches since I learned the version 11º or 12º and now the are in the 17º version, however, the commands still can be useful.\nWe are going to work a lot with the dplyrpackage. You need to load the package just once when you open your environment. If you have any question, please check our other material to start learning R. However, the best way to learn is try different approaches (;"

What we describe is not a specific “formula” for data analysis—something like “apply this method and then run that test”— but rather is a general process that can be applied in a variety of situations. Through our extensive experience both managing data analysts and conducting our own data analyses, we have carefully observed what produces coherent results and what fails to produce useful insights into data.

This excellent book provides a broad approach to why data management is essential. Also, it offers us all the chapters and exercises in a repo to replicate them.\n“The ‘data revolution’ offers many new opportunities for research in the social sciences. Increasingly, social and political interactions can be recorded digitally, leading to vast amounts of new data available for research. This poses new challenges for organizing and processing research data. This comprehensive introduction covers the entire range of data management techniques, from flat files to database management systems. It demonstrates how established techniques and technologies from computer science can be applied in social science projects, drawing on a wide range of different applied examples. This book covers simple tools such as spreadsheets and file-based data storage and processing, as well as more powerful data management software like relational databases. It goes on to address advanced topics such as spatial data, text as data, and network data.

It doesn’t matter if you work alone, in a small or in a big team. It doesn’t matter if your work gets (peer-)reviewed or audited: the techniques presented in this book will make your projects more reliable and save you a lot of frustration!\nAs someone whose primary job is analysing data, you might think that you are not a developer. It seems as if developers are these genius types that write extremely high-quality code and create these super useful packages. The truth is that you are a developer as well. It’s just that your focus is on writing code for your purposes to get your analyses going instead of writing code for others. Or at least, that’s what you think.

In this case, ggplot2 helps us learn the core of how ggplot2 works and how we can get the best advantage of it.\n“This book provides a hands-on introduction to ggplot2 with lots of example code and graphics. It also explains the grammar on which ggplot2 is based. Like other formal systems, ggplot2 is useful even when you don’t understand the underlying model. However, the more you learn about it, the more effectively you’ll be able to use ggplot2. This book will introduce you to ggplot2 assuming that you’re a novice, unfamiliar with the grammar; teach you the basics so that you can re-create plots you are already familiar with; show you how to use the grammar to create new types of graphics; and eventually turn you into an expert who can build new components to extend the grammar.”\n\n\n\nGo to ggplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCite\n\n\n\nHadley, W.

Spatial data analysis is the process of analyzing data that is located in space. This type of data can be used to answer a wide variety of questions, such as:\n\nHow does the distribution of crime vary across a city?\nWhat are the factors that contribute to the spread of a disease?\nHow can we predict the location of future earthquakes?\n\nSpatial statistics is a branch of statistics that is specifically designed for the analysis of spatial data. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to spatial statistics, from the basics to advanced topics. It also uses the R programming language, which is a powerful and flexible tool for spatial data analysis.\nIn this book, you will learn about:\n\nThe basics of spatial statistics, such as spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression.\nHow to use the R programming language to implement spatial statistical methods.\nHow to use spatial statistics to solve real-world problems.\n\n\n\n\nGo to Spatial Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCite\n\n\n\nMoraga, P.

One of them is Spatial Analysis and this book provides a robust theoretical and practical background using R for Spatial analysis. It’s updated and delivers clear examples of how spatial data is super useful for data analysis and other purposes.\n“This book introduces and explains the concepts underlying spatial data: points, lines, polygons, rasters, coverages, geometry attributes, data cubes, reference systems, as well as higher-level concepts including how attributes relate to geometries and how this affects analysis. The relationship of attributes to geometries is known as support, and changing support also changes the characteristics of attributes. Some data generation processes are continuous in space, and may be observed everywhere. Others are discrete, observed in tesselated containers. In modern spatial data analysis, tesellated methods are often used for all data, extending across the legacy partition into point process, geostatistical and lattice models. It is support (and the understanding of support) that underlies the importance of spatial representation. The book aims at data scientists who want to get a grip on using spatial data in their analysis. To exemplify how to do things, it uses R”\n\n\n\nGo to Spatial Data Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCite\n\n\n\nPebesma, E., & Bivand, R. (2023). Spatial Data Science: With Applications in R.
