    "text": "Install R and Rstudio: why R rocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR provides a versatile and powerful toolset for users of all skill levels, making it the go-to choice if you’re looking for a cutting-edge solution for your data analysis needs. R has everything you need to advance your data analysis, regardless of your experience level or where you are in your career. We assure you won’t be disappointed, so why not join the millions of happy users who have already switched to R?\nR is a free, open-source programming language that is widely used in data analysis and statistical computing. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easier to write and run R code. Installing R and RStudio is straightforward and can be done in a few simple steps:\n\nWhy R?\nDue to its many benefits in statistical computing and data analysis, R is a strong and flexible programming language that has gained popularity recently. Here are some of the main benefits of using R:\n\nOpen source software: R is open source, so users can access and alter the source code to tailor the program to their needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages: Users can use R’s extensive package library to add functionality for specialized tasks like tables, visualization, and data manipulation. Right now, there are more than 18,000 packages available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy to use: R has an intuitive user interface that makes it simple for new users to learn and offers advanced features for seasoned users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Install R\nFirst, you need to install R on your computer. You can download the latest version of R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website. Follow these steps:\n\nGo to the CRAN website and click on the “Download R for (Windows/MacOS/Linux)” link.\nChoose your operating system from the list and click on the corresponding link to download the installation file.\nOnce the file is downloaded, run the installation program and follow the instructions.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Install RStudio\nThe latest version of RStudio can be downloaded from the RStudio website. After you have installed R, you can install RStudio, an optional but highly recommended IDE for R. The following actions should be taken.\n\nVisit the RStudio website and select “RStudio Desktop” from the list of available products.\nFrom the list, select your operating system, and then click the link to download the installation file.\nRun the installation program after the file has been downloaded, then adhere to the prompts.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Launch RStudio\nOnce you have installed R and RStudio, you can launch RStudio by double-clicking on its icon . When you first launch RStudio, you will be prompted to select a version of R to use. If you have installed only one version of R, it should be automatically selected. Otherwise, you can choose the version of R that you want to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady\n\n\n\nYou’ve now successfully installed R and RStudio on your computer. Now that R and RStudio are installed, you can begin writing and running R code."

It also explains the grammar on which ggplot2 is based. Like other formal systems, ggplot2 is useful even when you don’t understand the underlying model. However, the more you learn about it, the more effectively you’ll be able to use ggplot2.\nThis book will introduce you to ggplot2 assuming that you’re a novice, unfamiliar with the grammar; teach you the basics so that you can re-create plots you are already familiar with; show you how to use the grammar to create new types of graphics; and eventually turn you into an expert who can build new components to extend the grammar.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to ggplot2\n\n\n\nCheck the material of the book on GitHub\n\n\n\nGo to ggplot2’s github repo"

No previous knowledge of R is necessary, although some experience with programming may be helpful. The statistical concepts used to answer the case study questions are only briefly introduced, so a Probability and Statistics textbook is highly recommended for in-depth understanding of these concepts. If you read and understand all the chapters and complete all the exercises, you will be well-positioned to perform basic data analysis tasks and you will be prepared to learn the more advanced concepts and skills needed to become an expert.”\n\nPart 1: Basics of R and the tidyverse Learn R throughout the book Building blocks needed to keep learning\nPart 2: Data visualization with ggplot2 Use ggplot2 to generate graphs Describe important data visualization principles\nPart 3: Statistics with R Answer case study questions using probability, inference, and regression Demonstrate the importance of statistics in data analysis\nPart 4: Data wrangling with tidyverse Familiarize the reader with data wrangling Specific skills include web scraping, using regular expressions, and joining and reshaping data tables\nPart 5: Machine learning with caret Introduce machine learning through challenges Use the caret package to build prediction algorithms including K-nearest neighbors and random forests\nPart 6: Productivity tools for data science Brief introduction to productivity tools used in data science projects Tools include RStudio, UNIX/Linux shell, Git and GitHub, and knitr and R Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Intro to Data Science"

These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data you have.

These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time.

The relationship of attributes to geometries is known as support, and changing support also changes the characteristics of attributes. Some data generation processes are continuous in space, and may be observed everywhere. Others are discrete, observed in tesselated containers. In modern spatial data analysis, tesellated methods are often used for all data, extending across the legacy partition into point process, geostatistical and lattice models. It is support (and the understanding of support) that underlies the importance of spatial representation. The book aims at data scientists who want to get a grip on using spatial data in their analysis. To exemplify how to do things, it uses R”\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Spatial Data Science"
