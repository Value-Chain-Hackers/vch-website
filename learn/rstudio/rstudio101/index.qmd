# Welcome to RStudio

![](images/rstudio1.png){fig-align="center"}

This is the window that appears to us when we open R. As you can see, there are multiple things that we will check. But, first we are going to create our first project.

# Creating our first project

## Step 1: Opening a new project

![](images/rstudio2.png){fig-align="center"}

-   We will go to File tab and click in "New Project".

| 1.-Create Project | 2.-Project Type |
|------|------|

|  Here you have three options: since you are creating a new project, choose New Directory. |   Select the type of project, as you can see, we have different options; or now, we will choose New Project   |


## Step 2: Create our first project

-   Once we open a new project, we need to decide where we want to store our project and all the code we will generate. I'll talk about this later, but putting a project in a separate folder is good practice to have everything ordered.

Your name project should be precise and not too long. In our case, we will name it "Hertie Coding Club R"



| 3.-Choose folder | 4.-Icon project in project folder |
|------|------|

|  Here we show the folder in where we will save our project |   Once you created your project, it should appear an icon like this within your folder.   |
