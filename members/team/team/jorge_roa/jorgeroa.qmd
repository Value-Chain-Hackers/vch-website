Hello! I'm Jorge! I have a background in public policy and a passion for using data to inform decision-making. My interests include:

- Data Science for Public Policy: I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science for Public Policy at Hertie School in Berlin, Germany. I believe that data science can be a powerful tool for addressing complex public policy challenges, and I'm excited to continue exploring this field.

- Teaching and Education: I'm passionate about teaching. I've worked as a teaching assistant for courses on quantitative methods and public policy evaluation. I'm also the founder of the Hertie Coding Club, a space where students can learn programming skills for data analysis, wrangling and public policy.
