# About Me {{< fa regular address-card >}}

<hr>

I'm Professor of Data Science and Public Policy at the Hertie School in Berlin and Director of the Data Science Lab. My research focuses on public opinion, attitude formation in the digital age, and the use of online data in social research. I use experimental methods, online data, and innovative measurement strategies to study how people act and think, politically.

# Teaching {{< fa solid person-chalkboard >}}

<hr>

I regularly teach graduate students about causal inference, online data collection, and computational social science in general. You can find syllabi [here](https://simonmunzert.com/teaching.html).

### Automated Data Collection with R 

- Together with Christian Rubba, [Peter Meißner](https://petermeissner.de/) and [Dominic Nyhuis](https://dominicnyhuis.com/), I've written a book, Automated Data Collection with R - A Practical Guide to Web Scraping and Text Mining. The [book](http://www.r-datacollection.com/) has been published at John Wiley & Sons in 2015.
