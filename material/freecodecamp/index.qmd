freeCodeCamp is a platform that offers free, self-paced, interactive online courses in various areas of computer science, including web development, data science, data analysis, and machine learning. I've used it a couple of times and it's incredible powerful. It can be used by beginners and advanced students, the curriculum includes hands-on projects that help students build practical skills and portfolios. The organization aims to provide accessible, high-quality education to anyone interested in programming.

This platform is completely free and is a good option if you want to practice and learn different skills.
