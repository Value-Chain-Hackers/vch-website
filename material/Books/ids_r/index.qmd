What I like about this book is that it gives you exercises, practice code, and the theory behind visualization and storytelling. Kieran Healy provides fantastic examples of plots and makes you understand the critical concepts behind ggplot. If you want to have a solid theoretical basis for plots and practical examples, this is your bible now.

"This book is meant to be a textbook for a first course in Data Science. No previous knowledge of R is necessary, although some experience with programming may be helpful. The statistical concepts used to answer the case study questions are only briefly introduced, so a Probability and Statistics textbook is highly recommended for in-depth understanding of these concepts. If you read and understand all the chapters and complete all the exercises, you will be well-positioned to perform basic data analysis tasks and you will be prepared to learn the more advanced concepts and skills needed to become an expert."
