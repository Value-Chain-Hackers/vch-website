Probably Charles Severance is one of the most famous people that teaches Python. In his book, he covers multiple topics in an approachable way. Also, one of the advantages of this material is that he offers free materials, lectures, and even certificates from edX and freecodecamp. Python is by far the most popular programming language in the world, and this course is an excellent opportunity to start learning this skill. 

"Python for Everybody is an introduction to the basics of coding in Python 3 with an emphasis on practical usage. It is intended as a foundation for students who are looking to apply Python within other academic subjects as well as in preparation for the serious study of computer science."
